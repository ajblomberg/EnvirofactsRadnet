This set of code has been designed to download all RadNet data availabe from the EPA Envirofacts website. The data is available through an API interface, as described here: https://www.epa.gov/enviro/envirofacts-data-service-api. 

The final file is "XXXX". It has all information (sample, analysis and results) for all samples collected by AIR-FILTER and AIR-CHARCOAL.
